Welcome to **Sloane.dev**, a space where I share web dev insights, project breakdowns, design ideas, and the occasional wandering thought. Sometimes technical, sometimes personal; always genuine.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog is my corner of the internet where I write about things I'm learning, building, and thinking about. Expect a mix of:

- **Web Development** - tutorials, tips, and deep dives into frontend and backend topics
- **Project Logs** - breakdowns of side projects I'm working on
- **Design** - thoughts on UI/UX, aesthetics, and tools I find useful
- **Productivity** - experiments with workflows, tools, and systems
- **Random Thoughts** - ideas that don't fit neatly into a category

## About Me

I'm Sloane, a full-stack developer who enjoys building things for the web and writing about the process. I believe in learning in public, sharing what I know, what I'm figuring out, and occasionally what I got wrong.

## About This Site

This blog is built with [Astro](https://astro.build), using a modified version of [Astro Modular](https://astro-modular.pages.dev); a blog theme created by [David V. Kimball](https://davidvkimball.com). Astro Modular is designed for Obsidian users and turns your vault into a powerful CMS for instant blog publishing.

I've made some layout modifications and added small tweaks to suit my preferences, but the core foundation and philosophy remain true to the original. Credit goes to David for building such a well-structured, performant, and extensible theme.
